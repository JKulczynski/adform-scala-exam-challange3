*Dependencies*

To run this app you need IDE(i use InteliJ), Scala and Docker

You need also add to your build.sbt:

----
libraryDependencies += "org.apache.spark" %% "spark-sql" % "3.2.1"
enablePlugins(DockerPlugin)

docker / dockerfile := {
  val jarFile: File = (Compile / packageBin / sbt.Keys.`package`).value
  val jarTarget = s"/opt/spark/jars/${jarFile.getName}"
  new Dockerfile {
    from("spark:v3.2.1")
    add(jarFile, jarTarget)
    user("root")
    entryPoint("/opt/spark/bin/spark-submit", "--conf", "spark.jars.ivy=/tmp/.ivy", jarTarget)
  }
}

docker / imageNames := Seq(
  ImageName(s"${organization.value}/${name.value}:${version.value}")
)
----

*How to run?*

Clone this repository.

*Troubleshooting*

To be honest, i completely forgot how to dockerize. I am also aware that
i should not use Spark, but i dont know how to solve this challenge other than Spark SQL.
